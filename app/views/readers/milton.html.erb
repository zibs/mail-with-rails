(1655)
 
 
WHEN I consider how my light is spent	
  Ere half my days in this dark world and wide,	
  And that one Talent which is death to hide	
  Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent	
To serve therewith my Maker, and present	        5
  My true account, lest He returning chide,	
  “Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?”	
  I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent	
That murmur, soon replies, “God doth not need	
  Either man’s work or his own gifts. Who best	        10
  Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state	
Is kingly: thousands at his bidding speed,	
  And post o’er land and ocean without rest;	
  They also serve who only stand and wait.”</pre>
